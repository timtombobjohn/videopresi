# videopresi

The projects goal is to provide a simple video presentation tool for e.g. museums.
A homescreen showing some tiles containing previews of the videos which can be started by clicking on them.
If the visitor clicks again, no matter where, he gets back to the homescreen.


Originally planned to run on a RaspberryPi in "kiosk mode" connected to a touch screen.

It's my very first project.
